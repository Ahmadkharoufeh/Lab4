### Summary
After reading the section I'm confused on what I should be doing and how to access what it wants me to get to. I read the webstirs that were given along with watching  the videos. I was still confused as to what I should be doing and how to get there and all that. i tried to continued 
floowing what the paper said to so i was not sure if it was doing it right since i keep getting error codes. 

### Python Idle
shell vs file editor
shell is the easy way  to start python interpreter and used for sort coding. File editors are way harder to use and used to code longer things.

### Graphics

Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Easter is when the quantity is not that good because it has millions of pixels. The vector is bigger and way more clear but still way harder to do.

Lossless vs. Lossy Compression 
lossless when all the data from the original file is preserved lossy is when removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size.
File Formats

jpg: image format that uses lossy compression to create smaller file sizes.
gif: allows for animated images, something neither of the other formats mentioned here allow.
png: lossless data compression and was created to replace the GIF image format.
